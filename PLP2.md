# Names, Types and Binding in Switft

## Name
### Keywords
Swift comes with six (06) main types of keywords. See the Keywords and Punctuation section in this article for the definition of each types and respective examples. https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/LexicalStructure.html

### Naming requirements (enforced by compiler)
**Swift variables and constants have the same naming rules as most C-inspired programming languages**
- Must not start with a digit
- After the first character, digits are allowed
- Can begin with and include an underscore character
- Symbol names are case sensitive

**Other than that, Swift opens up all sorts of naming options, including the use of emoji characters to name your variables**

### Naming convention (standards in the community) 
Names of types and protocols are UpperCamelCase. Everything else is lowerCamelCase.

### Code sample
```
// Declare a String
var S = "hello";

// Declare an Integer
var I = 45;

// Declare a Float
var X = 4.5;

// Declare an Array of String
var AS: Array<String> = ["hello", "world"]
```
