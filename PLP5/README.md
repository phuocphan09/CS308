# Objects and Classes in Swift

## The fundamentals
### Naming conventions

### Two types of object abstraction: Struct and Class

> Structures and classes are general-purpose, flexible constructs that become the building blocks of your program’s code.

**The similarity:** 
> Both *structure* and *class* come with the following functions:
- Define properties to store values
- Define methods to provide functionality
- Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax
- Define initializers to set up their initial state
- Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation


**The difference:**
> Class comes with more capabilities (see details below) with the cost of extra complexity
> **Hence, use classes when they’re appropriate or necessary!**

|Function|Structure|Class|
|-|-|-|
|Inheritance|Does **not** support|Support!|
|Check type of an instance|Does **not** support|Support!|
|De-initialize an instance (to free up spaces)|Does **not** support|Support!|
