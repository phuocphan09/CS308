# CS308

What is the name of your language?

When/where was it created, and by whom? Was it written to address a particular problem or need?

What types of programming is your language primarily used for (ex: web sites, video games, mobile devices, parsing, etc.)? If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of different projects it's been used for.

Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it? At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.

# The history of Swift
Swift was first announced in 2014 by Apple at their annual Developer Conference WWDC to replace the long-lasted Objective-C. The programming is born to help innovate applications on Apple's devices - not only mobile gadgets but also the computers.

# Swift's primary materials
Apple has been consolidating the documentation for Swift here: https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html. This source not only introduce beginners' concepts but also included details of their most advanced and up-to-date concepts. If you're new to programming in general, Apple also provides a very intuitive introduction to Swift and basic programming concepts through a special platform called "Swift Playground".

# "Hello, World!" with Swift
## Install Swift on AppStore
On your Mac machine, visit this link and follow the on-screen instruction to install Xcode https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12
Xcode is an all-in-one platform to interact with Swift, no further installation is required.

## Write "Hello, World!" in Swift
### Start Swift
Swift is placed in the Launchpad of your Mac after successfully installed. Click on its icon to begin!

I'll create an iOS app for iPhone. Select the options according to your preference. From now on, your selected device at this step will be referred as "target device".

### Typing code in Xcode
Apple by default completed the "Hello, World" code for you. 

### Comments in Xcode
Just like Java, use "//" for in-line/single-line comments and "/* .. */" for multi-line comments

## Build and Run the program
Choose Product > Run to start building your code. A "simulator" of your target device will show up. 
Notice: It might take a while on the first run.
