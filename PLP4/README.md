# Functions in Swift

## Loops in Swift
> Swift supports 3 main types of loops: For-in, While and Repeat-while

### For-in loop
> Use the for-in loop to iterate over a sequence, such as items in an array, ranges of numbers, or characters in a string

Insert code

### While loop
> While loop performs a set of statements until a condition becomes false
> "while" evaluates its condition at the start of each pass through the loop
Insert code

### Repeat-while loop
> "repeat-while" evaluates its condition at the end of each pass through the loop

Insert code


## Functions in Swift

### The fundamentals
> Declaring a function in Swift requires function name, parameters with their respective data type, and the return type (unless it's "void")
> Swift supports multiple parameters with different data types
> Functions in Swift could be placed before or after its call

Insert code

### Returning multiple values within one function
> Swifts supports multiple-value returns natively. No tricks is required to achieve this!
> Declare the list of return variable while declaring the function. Values will be returned via a named tuple

Insert code

### Pass-by in Swift
> The pass-by mode in Swift is explicitly indicated in any function headers
> Variables with 'inout' sign will use pass-by-reference. And the missing of this sign indicates the default pass-by-value

Insert code

### Recursive functions
> Swift does support recursive functions

Insert code
